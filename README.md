# EZTrack

EZTrack produces electrode weights and heatmap scores from EEG signals in EDF or MEF files.

Consult the README's in each of the included projects for more information:

## mef_lib_2_0

This is a modified version of the MEF v2.0 source code distributed by the [Mayo Clinic's MEF website](http://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/epilepsy-neurophysiology/mef-example-source-code). The code posted on the site was in an unworking state, so this distribution corrects mistakes such as missing headers, inconsistent method declarations, and adds a makefile.

There is also [MEF >= v2.1 code on Github](https://github.com/benbrinkmann/mef_lib_2_1). Since the JHH uses MEF v2.0, this distribution
is being used for now.
